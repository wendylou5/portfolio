        <h2>Career</h2>
      
          <p>Schumer portrayed a young woman diagnosed with breast cancer in the off-Broadway black comedy Keeping Abreast. She started doing stand-up comedy on June 1, 2004, when she first performed at Gotham Comedy Club. In 2007, she recorded a Live at Gotham episode for Comedy Central before appearing on Last Comic Standing; she said in August 2012 that she thought of the episode as her &quot;big break.&quot;</p>

          <p>After not passing an audition for an earlier season, she advanced to the finals of the fifth season of the NBC reality television talent show Last Comic Standing and placed fourth. Schumer said in April 2011, &quot;Last Comic was totally fun. I had a great time because there was no pressure on me; I had been doing stand-up around two years. I wasn't supposed to do well. So every time I advanced it was a happy surprise. I kept it honest on the show and it served me well.&quot;</p>
      
        <p>Schumer co-starred in the Comedy Central reality show Reality Bites Back in 2008. In 2009, she appeared in an advertising campaign for Butterfinger.

Her standup comedy special Mostly Sex Stuff premiered on Comedy Central on August 18, 2012, to positive reviews. Schumer said in February 2012, &quot;I don't like the observational stuff. I like tackling the stuff nobody else talks about, like the darkest, most serious thing about yourself. I talk about life and sex and personal stories and stuff everybody can relate to, and some can't.&quot;</p>
      
        <p>In June 2012, Schumer began work on a sketch comedy series for Comedy Central. The show features single-camera vignettes of Schumer playing &quot;heightened versions&quot; of herself.

Inside Amy Schumer was picked up for a second season that began in 2014. A behind-the-scenes miniseries entitled Behind Amy Schumer premiered in 2012. The third season premiered on April 21, 2015, with a fourth season ordered the same day. </p>
      
        <p>In 2014, Schumer embarked on her Back Door Tour to promote the second season of her show. The show featured closing act Bridget Everett, whom Schumer cites as her favorite live performer. She also appeared as a guest on an episode of comedian Jerry Seinfeld's internet series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee in 2014. </p>

        <h2>In the media</h2>
        
          <p>In 2015, Schumer was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people.</p>
        
          <p>Schumer has received much praise for the subversive feminism of her comedy, and for cleverly addressing various social issues through comedy. She has also faced criticism for, according to Monica Heisey of The Guardian, &quot;a shockingly large blind spot around race.&quot; In June 2015, Schumer initially responded to such criticism, saying &quot;I go in and out of playing an irreverent idiot. That includes making dumb jokes involving race...Trust me. I am not racist.&quot; The Washington Post then published an op-ed piece by Dr. Stacey Patton, adjunct professor of American history at American University, and Dr. David J. Leonard, Associate Professor in the Department of Critical Culture, Gender and Race Studies at Washington State University, criticizing Schumer’s attitude on race in comedy; an article which was widely deprecated. A few days later, Dr. Patton admitted she had not watched any of Schumer's work before writing the article, which was pitched to her by The Washington Post.</p>
